# Games collection

This repository contains the (board)games I have programmed in Python. I'm not sure what the purpose of this repository is, to be honest. The games have no frontend and can only be "played" in simulations with certain playing tactics.

- Quartets - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartets_(card_game)): Certainly not the most exciting game to play, but the logic is great for programming! Safe to say that programming this game was the most fun I had with quartets!
- Azul - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azul_(board_game)): This is a fun game and it looks terrific, too! When we bought it we were one person too many. Is it weird to volunteer for skipping the first games so you can program it instead?!
